# DataMining_apartment_rent_dataset
This project was part of my Data Mining course at university. I worked on the apartment_rent.csv dataset, which contains valuable information about houses, their characteristics, and rental prices. I applied various data mining techniques to uncover insights into factors influencing rental prices.

The project includes:

  -Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset.
  
  -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations (e.g., histograms, joint plots, and KDE plots).
  
  -Correlation analysis to explore relationships between features.
  
  -Statistical analysis to gain deeper insights into rental pricing patterns.

This analysis provides meaningful insights into how different factors, such as amenities and house characteristics, affect rental prices.

The 'apartment_ren.csv' which is the main dataset ,and 'dallas.png' which is needed in the part 3 of the project are uploaded.
